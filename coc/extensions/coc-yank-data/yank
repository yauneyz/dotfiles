	Layer-wise sparsity levels resulting from pruning ResNet50 with a variety of methods. ResNet50 layers are divided into two different groups, convolutional layers and shortcut layers. The x-axis represents increasing depth within the network. We can see that "coherence\_best" and "magnitude\_worst" severely pruned the early layers, which is likely responsible for the lesser performance of the resulting networks.

	The results found in \ref{fig:pruned_linear_generalization_gap} suggest that coherence pruning might generalize better than magnitude pruning. However, the fact that random pruning generalizes so well calls this into question. If random pruning does well, then could it be the case that coherence pruning simply does a better job of approximating random pruning and thus generalizes better?

		We show how it is possible to take mask out 90\% of the parameters in a network and get a sub-network that is just as good as the original one. The method for doing this requires only one additional epoch of computation. It is done by tracking the sum of the sign of the gradient over one epoch of training, and then pruning the weights for the absolute value of the associated gradient sign sum is smallest. We compare this to random and magnitude based methods and find that for layerwise pruning, our method is superior even though it does not require additional training. We find that for the InceptionV3 network our method is able to prune 90\% of the parameters without a loss in accuracy.

	%This idea fits well with \citet{arpit_closer_nodate}, where they showed that many samples (the "easy" ones) are consistently classified correctly from early in training while the "hard" samples are learned later in the training. One use of the coherence metric is that it allows us to distinguish between these two regimes.
